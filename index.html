        Our first collection is about the importance and beauty of mushrooms. Mushrooms are a rich, low calorie source of fiber, protein, and antioxidants. They break down dead, organic matter and by doing that they release nutrients and those nutrients are then made available for plants to carry on growing.
        They may also mitigate the risk of developing serious health conditions, such as Alzheimer's, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. </h2>

      Our next step as an organization will be to secure funding so that we can create a decentralized organization or a DAO. By having a DOA we'd be able to set up a living wage fund which black artists can apply to receive finacial support for 6 months of living expenses.</h2>
